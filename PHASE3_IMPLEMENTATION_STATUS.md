# Phase 3 Implementation Status

## Overview
Phase 3 (Feature Development) implementation has been organized into 4 waves with parallel development tracks to maximize efficiency while respecting dependencies.

## Implementation Plan

### Wave 1 (Days 1-3) - Foundation Components

1. **Section 3.4 Algorithm Implementation** âœ… COMPLETED
   - Branch: `feature/3.4-algorithm-implementation`
   - Status: Implemented and tested
   - Coverage: 100% test coverage
   - Key files:
     - Partnership generation algorithm
     - Round-robin scheduling
     - Court assignment optimization
     - Bye rotation for odd players
     - Comprehensive validation

2. **Section 3.1 Authentication System** ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS
   - Branch: `feature/3.1-authentication-system`
   - Tasks:
     - Magic link login flow
     - Player claim mechanism
     - Session management
     - Error handling

3. **Section 3.7 Realtime Foundation** ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS
   - Branch: `feature/3.7-realtime-foundation`
   - Tasks:
     - Supabase Realtime setup
     - Connection management
     - Reconnection logic
     - Base subscription system

### Wave 2 (Days 4-6) - Core Features
**Status: PENDING**

1. **Section 3.2 Dashboard & Navigation**
   - Branch: `feature/3.2-dashboard-navigation`
   - Dependencies: Authentication (3.1)

2. **Section 3.3 Play Date Management**
   - Branch: `feature/3.3-play-date-management`
   - Dependencies: Authentication (3.1)

3. **Section 3.4 Scheduling UI**
   - Branch: `feature/3.4-scheduling-ui`
   - Dependencies: Algorithms (3.4), Authentication (3.1)

### Wave 3 (Days 7-9) - Advanced Features
**Status: PENDING**

1. **Section 3.5 Score Entry**
   - Branch: `feature/3.5-score-entry`
   - Dependencies: Play Date Management (3.3), Scheduling (3.4)

2. **Section 3.7 Realtime Completion**
   - Branch: `feature/3.7-realtime-completion`
   - Dependencies: Realtime Foundation (3.7), Score Entry (3.5)

### Wave 4 (Days 10-12) - Final Features
**Status: PENDING**

1. **Section 3.6 Rankings & Statistics**
   - Branch: `feature/3.6-rankings-statistics`
   - Dependencies: Score Entry (3.5), Match data

## Branch Strategy

```
master
  â”œâ”€â”€ feature/3.1-authentication-system
  â”œâ”€â”€ feature/3.7-realtime-foundation
  â”œâ”€â”€ feature/3.4-algorithm-implementation âœ…
  â”œâ”€â”€ feature/3.2-dashboard-navigation
  â”œâ”€â”€ feature/3.3-play-date-management
  â”œâ”€â”€ feature/3.4-scheduling-ui
  â”œâ”€â”€ feature/3.5-score-entry
  â”œâ”€â”€ feature/3.6-rankings-statistics
  â””â”€â”€ develop (integration branch)
```

## Validation Criteria

Each section must meet:
- â‰¥90% test coverage for critical logic
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Mobile-first design (â‰¥44px touch targets)
- Performance targets (2s load, <1s real-time)
- Security requirements (RLS, input sanitization)

## Next Steps

1. Complete Wave 1 implementations (Auth & Realtime)
2. Merge completed sections to develop branch
3. Integration testing after each wave
4. Final merge to master with v1.0.0-alpha tag

## Critical Path

The critical path runs through:
1. Authentication (blocks most features)
2. Play Date Management (blocks scheduling UI)
3. Score Entry (blocks rankings)
4. Rankings & Statistics (final feature)

Total estimated timeline: 14-18 days with 4-5 developers working in parallel.
