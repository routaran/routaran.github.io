# Pre-Development Planning Checklist

*Last Updated: 2025-07-08*

This document outlines the essential planning steps that need to be completed before starting development on the Pickleball Tracker application.

## Essential Planning Steps

### 1. **UI Design & Wireframes** (Priority: Critical)
Create low-fidelity wireframes for:
- **Mobile views (primary):**
  - Login/magic link flow
  - Dashboard with match cards
  - Score entry interface
  - Rankings view
- **Desktop responsive layouts**
- **Component library decisions** (confirm shadcn/ui components)

### 2. **Database Schema Design** (Priority: Critical)
Create a detailed database schema including:
- Tables: `play_dates`, `players`, `player_claims`, `partnerships`, `matches`, `match_results` (view), `audit_log`
- Partnership-based design for enhanced reporting capabilities
- Relationships and foreign keys
- Indexes for performance
- Version field for optimistic locking in matches table
- Audit trail structure for score edits

### 3. **Row-Level Security (RLS) Policies** (Priority: Critical)
Define Supabase RLS policies for:
- Project Owner access (full admin)
- Organizer permissions (Play Date creator)
- Player permissions (score entry for their matches)
- Visitor permissions (read-only)

### 4. **Round-Robin Algorithm Specification** (Priority: Critical)
Document the algorithm for:
- Generating all possible doubles partnerships (4-16 players)
- Scheduling matches to minimize wait times
- Handling bye rounds for odd player counts
- Court assignment optimization (max 4 courts)

### 5. **Project Setup & Configuration** (Priority: High)
- Initialize React/Vite/TypeScript project
- Configure Supabase project and environment variables
- Set up GitHub Pages deployment workflow
- Configure ESLint, Prettier, and testing framework

## Recommended Minimal Approach

Since the goal is to keep planning simple and short, here's a streamlined approach:

### 1. **Quick UI Mockups**
- Simple sketches or use a tool like Excalidraw for key screens
- Focus on mobile-first design
- Document component choices from shadcn/ui

### 2. **Database & Security Design**
- One document combining schema and RLS policies
- Include sample SQL for table creation
- Document relationships clearly (especially partnership-match relationships)
- Define materialized view for match_results calculations

### 3. **Round-Robin Algorithm**
- Pseudocode or flowchart is sufficient
- Include worked example with 8 players
- Document edge cases (odd players, court constraints)

### Skip These (Implement as You Go)
- Formal API documentation
- Detailed state management design
- Comprehensive test plan (beyond the 90% coverage requirement)
- Offline/PWA functionality (out of scope)
- Push notification system (out of scope)

## Next Steps

1. Complete the three minimal design documents above
2. Set up the development environment
3. Create initial project structure
4. Begin iterative development with the Dashboard as the first feature

This approach provides just enough design work to start coding confidently while avoiding analysis paralysis.
