I want you to review #$ARGUMENTS of my dev checklist and build plan to implement it. I want each section of the phase developed in its own branch and then merged into the master branch when complete. The branches should be named according to the section titles in the phase, and the commit messages should reflect the changes made in each section.
Have a master agent that will coordinate the work of the other agents. I want as much of the work as possible to be done in parallel by sub agents, but I also want to ensure that the work is done in a logical order respecting dependencies between tasks & sections.
As each sub agent completes their work, they should notify the master agent. The master agent should then validate the work done against the checklist and the project requirements. If the work is not validated, the master agent should provide feedback to the sub agent and request changes. If the sub agent is unable to fix the issues, the master agent should escalate the issue to a human for resolution.
The master agent should also provide update the dev checklist as it progresses through the tasks, marking them as completed and give the user a percentage estimate of how much of the work is complete.
Once all the sections are completed and validated, the master agent should write a short summary of the work done which can be used as input for the next phase of the project and delete any transitional documentation that is no longer needed.
